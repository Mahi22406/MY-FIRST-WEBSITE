<h4>For several generations</h4>, <p>stories from Africa have traditionally been passed down by word of mouth. Often, after a hard dayâ€™s work, the adults would gather the children together by moonlight, around <b>a village fire and tell stories</b>. This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'. <h1>Usually, the stories</h1> are meant to </p>prepare young people for life, and so each story taught a lesson or moral. 

<p><h1>In the African folktales</h1></p>, <i>the stories reflect</i> the culture where diverse types of animals abound. The animals and birds are often accorded human attributes, so it is not uncommon to <h3>find animals talking,</h3> singing, or demonstrating other human characteristics such as greed, jealousy, honesty, etc. The setting in <em>many</em> of the stories exposes the reader to the land form and climate within <strong>that region</strong> of Africa. References are often made to different seasons such as the 'dry' or 'rainy' season and their various effects on the surrounding <p><i>vegetation and animal life.</i></p>
