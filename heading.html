<h3>Folktales and myths serve as a means of handing down traditions and customs from one generation to the next in Africa. 
    For several generations,</h3> stories from Africa have traditionally been passed down by word of mouth. Often, after a hard dayâ€™s work, the adults would gather the children together by moonlight, <p><b><i>around a village fire and tell stories.</i></b></p> This was traditionally called 'Tales by Moonlight'. Usually, the stories are meant to prepare young people for life, and so each story taught a lesson or moral. 

<h1>In the African folktales</h1>, the stories reflect the culture where diverse types of animals abound. The animals and birds are <p><h5><b><i>often accorded human attributes,</i></b></h5></p> so it is not uncommon to find animals talking, <small>singing,</small> or <p><b><h2><i>demonstrating other human characteristics such </i></h2></b></p>as greed, <i><b>In the African folktales</b></i>, etc. The setting in many of <h1>the stories exposes</h1> the reader to the land form and climate <h2>within that region of Africa</h2>. References <h3>are often made to</h3> <p>In the African folktales</p> 'dry' or <h4>'rainy' season and</h4> their <h5>various effects</h5> on the surrounding <h6> vegetation and animal life.</h6>
